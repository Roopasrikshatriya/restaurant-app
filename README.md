# restaurant-app

This is a simple restaurant app where the waiters can take orders for each table from a list of courses. It
provides features such as filter the menu items by name or category, edit or add more items by clicking on table or drag and drop the items, once the order is done, generate the bill.

This is my first app towards my journey learning frontend.
